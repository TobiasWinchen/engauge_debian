Engauge can be installed in three ways:

Easy      - Installing a Linux package that is bundled in most versions of Linux. Sample commands are:

                  sudo apt-get install engauge-digitizer (Debian and Ubuntu)
                  sudo yum install engauge-digitizer     (Fedora and RedHat)

Less Easy - By downloading pre-built binaries for Windows and Linux. The pre-built binaries are available
            from the engauge6 project on github.com, at:

                  https://github.com/markummitchell/engauge-digitizer/releases

            *  2) 'sudo modprobe fuse'                                                *
            *  3) 'sudo usermod -a -G fuse <username>'                                *
            *  4) Logout and then log back in. These steps are only performed once    *

Difficult - By downloading the source code and building Engauge according to the steps in the INSTALL file in
            the highest level directory. The initial build process can take as little as 15 minutes or as long
	    as several hours, depending on the current compiler configuration, and the installed software 
	    packages (such as Qt, and libraries for graphics, fonts and math). WARNING - the source code is
            updated frequently, and may be less reliable than the releases (which receive more thorough testing)
