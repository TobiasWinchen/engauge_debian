1. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
1.1 Before installing a binary release
----------------------------
If you are installing a binary version of Engauge Digitizer, you do not need
to worry about installing other packages first. The required packages will either
be bundled with Engauge, or installed automatically if you are using a package
manager such as Ubuntu's Synaptic.

1.2 Before installing a source code release
-------------------------------------------
If you are compiling Engauge Digitizer from source code, the following two packages
must first be installed:

  1. Version 4 of Qt from qt.nokia.com

         *******************************************************************
         * Comments and warnings:                                          *
         * 1. Do NOT install Version 3! You must install version 4         *
         * 2. You may download the open source version for free, although  *
         *    purchasing a commercial version entitles you to customer     *
         *    support from the wonderful staff at Trolltech, and to        *
         *    include Qt in commercial products                            *
         * 3. The QTDIR environment variable must point to the Qt          *
         *    installation directory                                       *
         * 4. The PATH environment variable must point to the qmake tool   *
         *    of Qt. Hint - if you have compilation problems on a computer *
         *    with multiple versions of Qt, then try 'qmake -v' to see if  *
         *    you are using the wrong version of Qt. If so, then adjust    *
         *    your PATH variable to use Qt version 4                       *
         * 5. In Microsoft Windows the preferred setup is using QtSDK from *
         *    qt.nokia.com with the optional MinGW package installed       *
         *    during the QtSDK installation. Details are given below.      *
         *******************************************************************

  2. Version 3.1.2 of FFTW from www.fftw.org 

         *******************************************************************
         * Comments and warnings:                                          *
         * 1. Version 3.1.2 is guaranteed to work, although other versions *
         *    will probably also work                                      *
         * 2. Linux users may be able to install a package for their       *
         *    distribution using their standard package installer. This is *
         *    the preferred method.                                        *
         * 3. The FFTW source may be downloaded from www.fftw.org and      *
         *    installed manually. In this case, the standard instalation   *
         *    steps are followed:                                          *
         *    3a) ./configure                                              *
         *    3b) make                                                     *
         *    3c) make install                                             *
         *******************************************************************

Note that open source versions of both Qt and FFTW are freely available.


2. USER INSTALL - Mac OSX Executable Release
--------------------------------------------

Untar the executable release package. The executable name is Engauge.app.
The samples directory contains some sample image and document files, but 
it must be copied from inside the bundle. To copy the samples directory,
open the bundle using 'Show contents', then click on the Contents
directory, and then copy the samples directory.


3. USER INSTALL - MS Windows Executable Release
-----------------------------------------------

Unzip the executable release package. The executable name is 
digitizer.exe. The samples directory contains some sample image and 
document files.


4. USER INSTALL - Source Release
--------------------------------

This installation method is much harder than installing one of the 
executable releases. However, this is the only option for unsupported 
operating systems.

Building your own executable is not too much of a problem if you have 
already installed Qt from Trolltech (qt.nokia.com) installed, but
if you have yet to install the Qt toolkit, you may have much work 
ahead of you. 

There are two source release packages - zip file and tarball. Both contain
the same contents, and both work under MS Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, and
a wide variety of other platforms.


5. DEVELOPER INSTALL - Using Makefile
-------------------------------------------

1. See if Qt is installed. Some tricks are to try running 'qmake -v' and to
   look in '/usr/lib' for a directory like 'qt-3.3.3'
2. If Qt from Trolltech is not already installed, then
   install Qt/X11 (see http://qt.nokia.com/developer/platforms/index.html)
3. Get a copy of the source code using anonymous git
		git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/digitizer/code digitizer-code
   -OR-
   by downloading the source tarball from digitizer.sourceforge.net and running
   'tar xvfz digit-src-X_Y.tar.gz'
4. 'cd digitizer'
5. 'qmake -unix digitizer.pro'
6. 'make'
7. You can now run the digitizer executable



6. INTERNATIONALIZATION
------------------------

The following steps will create a translation file:

1. Open http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr for translations
2. Edit digitizer.pro to add the appropriate translation file, and
   check the modified file into cvs. This step is only performed for
   new languages, and is skipped if there is already an entry.
3. Run 'lupdate digitizer.pro' to create a 'digitizer_XX_YY.ts' file.
4. Run 'linguist digitizer_XX_YY.ts' and use the babelfish webpage to 
   translate
5. Save the modified *.ts file, being sure to check it into cvs so
   the changes will never be lost
6. Run 'lrelease digitizer_XX_YY.ts' to get the digitizer_XX_YY.qm file
7. Make sure main.cpp loads in the appropriate qm files

WARNING - I would like to gently discourage any volunteers from
attempting to translate the text of Engauge Digitizer. Some brave
volunteers have contacted me about translating from English, only 
to realize that the simple Engauge interface is actually hiding an
amazing amount of documentation. The work involved is really too 
much for a single volunteer - and that work would have to be
updated often because the code is still under development. I am
extremely pleased that people have volunteered for this task though!
