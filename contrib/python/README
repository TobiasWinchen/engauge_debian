CurveFitting.py             Python script that reads in a DIG file and performs polynomial curve fitting
ExampleParseDig.py          Python script that shows how to use ParseDig.py. This script dumps the DIG file specified in
                            the command line. This code can serve as a starting point for other scripts that can process
                            the information into other output formats - like SQL tables and NETCDF.
InsertDerivedColumn.py      Python script that reads in (longitude,latitude) points and output those points with a timestamp
                            at each point that is computed assuming a constant speed through the points
ParseDig.py                 Python class that reads Engauge Digitizer DIG files, and provides that information through a
                            very simplie application programming interface (API)
