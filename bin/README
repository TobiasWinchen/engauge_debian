Introduction
------------
This bin directory contains the executable that is built by successfully compiling
and linking Engauge Digitizer (http://digitizer.sourceforge.net).

Engauge.exe.local
-------------------
This file is a hack for Microsoft Windows 2000. As long as this file is in the same 
directory as engauge.exe, the Windows 2000 operating system will use the local dll files 
rather than the dll files that belong to the operating system. 

Licensing
---------
All of the files in this directory were created by an Engauge Digitizer developer, and 
are subject to the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; 
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
