Introduction
------------
This main directory and its subdirectories contain the Engauge Digitizer software
project (http://digitizer.sourceforge.net). 

Engauge Digitizer was created to fulfill a recurring need of the author - to conveniently
and quickly extract numbers from graph images.

If you are trying to build the software from source code, read file INSTALL in this
directory. You may also want to look at the fairly extensive documentation in the 
usermanual directory - that documentation is accessed by opening usermanual/index.html
in your browser. Further information may be found at http://digitizer.sourceforge.net.

Utilities
---------
A postprocessing utility found in the utility/tranpose directory may be used to transpose
the export files.

Date and time formats can be handled by opening the usermanual/dateconvert.html web page
in your browser.

Building the software
---------------------
Please note that this software is NOT compiled and linked using autoconf and automake.
Instead, this is built with the qmake utility provided by Trolltech (www.trolltech.com),
and requires the Qt library from the same company. More information about building this
software is found in the INSTALL file in the main directory. A GPL version of Qt is 
supplied with most Linux distributions for developing open source projects. Please 
refer to the Qt licensing restrictions at www.trolltech.com for further information.
