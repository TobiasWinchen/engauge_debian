Introduction
------------
This samples directory contains several sample image files that may be imported into
Engauge Digitizer (http://digitizer.sourceforge.net).

These files are listed below, with comments:

  corners.png - Graph that lots of corners that would be painful to digitize manually
  gridlines.gif - Graph with gridlines that are easily removed by Engauge
  gridlines_log.gif - Another graph with gridlines that are easily removed by Engauge
  gridlines_log.src - Creates gridlines_log.gif in gnuplot using 'load' command (not an image!)
  inverse.jpg - Image of y/x function
  inverse.png - Same as inverse.jpg but in png format
  linlog.jpg - Graph with linear/logarithmic coordinates
  linlog.png - Same as linlog.jpg but in png format
  loglin.png - Graph with logarithmic/linear coordinates
  loglog.png - Graph with logarithmic/logarithmic coordinates
  normdist.jpg - Graph of normal distribution
  normdist.png - Same as normdist.jpg but in png format
  pointmatch.jpg - Graph with fuzzy points for playing with Point Match feature of Engauge
  pointplot.bmp - Graph with points that are easily captured by Point Match feature of Engauge, if
    the Discretize settings are set to "Intensity 90 to 99" for the triangles, and 
    "Intensity 10 to 50" for the diamonds
  polarcircles.jpg - Polar plot for experimenting. No coordinates are displayed, so not very useful
  polarplot.jpg - Polar plot with cardioid pattern
  polarplot.png - Same as polarplot.jpg but in png format
  testcase.jpg - Simple graph that serves as an excellent starting point for the new user
  testcase.png - Same as testcase.jpg but in png format
  testcoords.jpg - Advanced graph used by developers to check the affine transformations in Engauge
  testcoords.sxd - Open Office document used to create testcoords.jpg (not an image!)
  usgs.png - Fictional map loosely based on U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps
