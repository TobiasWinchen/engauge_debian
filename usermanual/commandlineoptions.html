  Engauge Digitizer - Command Line Options</H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P>Engauge Digitizer accepts many command line options, and one environment
  variable, for more flexibility and power.</P>

<TABLE STYLE="PADDING: 3">

  <TR>
    <TH ALIGN="LEFT" COLSPAN=2><H1>Startup</H1></TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-import <i>FILE</i></TD>
    <TD>Automatically import the specified image file at startup. Image
    files may also be imported manually using the menu</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-open <i>FILE</i></TD>
    <TD>Automatically open the specified Engauge Digitizer document file at 
    startup. Document files may also be opened manually using the menu</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-help</TD>
    <TD>Display a list of command line options with some brief comments, and
    then exit</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-manual <i>DIRECTORY</i></TD>
    <TD>Look for the user manual in the specified directory. If Engauge
    Digitizer is run in a directory other than the installation directory,
    then the user manual directory must be specified using either this
    command line option or the ENGAUGE_USERMANUAL environment variable.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-axes <i>XMIN</i> <i>XMAX</i> <i>YMIN</i> <i>YMAX</i></TD>
    <TD>Scan the imported file at startup, and locate the X and Y axes. Then
    digitize axis points assuming the X axis ranges from <i>XMIN</i> to
    <i>XMAX</i>, and the Y axis ranges from <i>YMIN</i> to <i>YMAX</i>. The
    X axis is assumed to be near the bottom of the image, and the Y axis
    is assumed to be on the left side of the image. For speed, no 
    attempt to rotate the image if it is sideways, so the digitized points
    may require adjustment. This feature should be useful when 
    using Perl or other scripts to digitize many images with known 
    axes ranges. The axis points may also be digitized manually using
    the Digitize Axis Points mode</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-lazysegments</TD>
    <TD>Postpone scanning for segments that is normally performed during
    startup, until either the <A HREF="dlgsegments.html">Segments dialog</A>
    is used, or the <A HREF="answerlinegraph.html">Segment Fill</A> button
    is selected.</TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TH ALIGN="LEFT" COLSPAN=2><H1>Shutdown</H1></TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-export <i>FILE</i></TD>
    <TD>Automatically export the active document at shutdown. Documents
    may also be exported manually using the menu.</TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TH ALIGN="LEFT" COLSPAN=2><H1>Settings</H1></TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-reset</TD>
    <TD>Reset all settings to the factory defaults. This option is a
    fast and easy way to restore all settings to a useful configuration,
    especially when there are problems with one or more settings.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-text</TD>
    <TD>Load settings from a text file at startup, and save settings to
    the same text file when done, rather than use the Windows registry.
    That text file will be C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
    Data\engaugerc in Windows XP, and C:\Windows\All Users\Application 
    Data\engaugerc in Windows 98 and ME. Note that the Application Data 
    directory may be hidden, so although it will not appear when a 
    simple 'dir' command is used, you
    can still go into that directory using 'cd Application Data'. This
    option has no effect in Linux and Unix because the settings are
    always stored in a text file such as $HOME/.qt/engaugerc.</TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TH ALIGN="LEFT" COLSPAN=2><H1>Internationalization</H1></TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>-onlybmp</TD>
    <TD>Import all images as bitmap (BMP) files. This is a fix for
    Chinese Windows.</TD>

    <TD>-pixels</TD>
    <TD>Show cursor location in pixel coordinates rather than graph 
    coordinates</TD>

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>ENGAUGE_BROWSER</TD>
    <TD>To start up the date/time converter from within Engauge Digitizer,
    this environment variable must be set to the shell command that runs
    a javascript-capable browser. This environment variable is not used
    in Microsoft Windows. Examples are 'firefox', 'konqueror', ...</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>ENGAUGE_USERMANUAL</TD>
    <TD>If set, this specifies the directory containing the user manual. This
    option, like the '-manual' command line option, is used when running
    Engauge Digitizer in a directory other than the installation 
    directory.</TD>
