<H2>What Is Grid Removal?</H2>
<P>Grid lines in an original image interfere with the automatic line
  and point detection algorithms in Engauge Digitizer. In most 
  cases, however, the grid lines can be quickly removed using 
  one of the grid removal features offered by Engauge 
  Digitizer. The resulting processed image can be automatically digitized
  using <A HREF="tutorautolinegraph.html#segmentfill">Segment Fill</A> and 
  <A HREF="tutorautopointgraph.html#pointmatch">Point Match</A>.</P>
<P>Here is an example of how grid removal can clean up an image:</P>

<H2>How Do I Control Grid Removal?</H2>
<P>By simply changing the Grid Removal settings, grid lines can usually be
  removed.</P>
<P>Use the Settings/Grid Removal dialog to experiment with various
  discretizing settings. You can get more information about the 
  <A HREF="dlggridremoval.html">Grid Removal dialog</A>.</P>
