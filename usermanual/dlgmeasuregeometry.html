  Engauge Digitizer - Measure Geometry Window</H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P>
The measure geometry window shows angles, distances and areas for the
currently active measure (which is displayed in the Digitize toolbar). 
Regions in the window may be selected and then exported to other 
applications by either copying or dragging. Control-C is used for copying.
</P>
<P>
At each point, the angle is defined between the line from the previous
point, and the line to the next point.
</P>
<P>
At each point, the distance is defined as the length of the line to 
the next point.
</P>
<P>
The functional area of the measure is the area calculated by integrating
the area under the curve. The polygonal area of the measure is the 
area within the polygon through all of the points in the measure.
</P>
<P>
Until the coordinates are defined by axes points or a scale bar, the 
measure geometry window will show information in the screen coordinates, which
are in units of pixels. Afterwards, the geometry measurements are in the
measure coordinates.
</P>
<P>
An example of a measure geometry window is shown below. The FuncArea
may be ignored since it is not useful for a measure.
The PolyArea is the area inside
the closed polygon. The distances along the measure, in either 
direction, are shown, along with the angle at each point, and the
coordinates of each point.
