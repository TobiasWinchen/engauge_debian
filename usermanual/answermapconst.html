  Engauge Digitizer - Map Constraints</H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H3>Projections</H3>
<P>Currently, only (somewhat common) cylindrical lat/lon coordinates, 
and (very rare) polar lat/lon coordinates are supported.</P>
<P>Such popular projections as Lambert, Mercator and UTM are not supported,
and any attempts to accurately digitize such projections will not succeed.</P>
<P>In the future, a generalized warping algorithm may be added which
would support the vast majority of map projections. Besides being
extremely flexible, this approach would be easy to learn and work
even in cases where details of the original map projection are not
known. However, the disadvantages of the generalized warping
algorithm would be that lat/lon lines must exist in the map, and
accuracy will probably be degraded.</P>
<H3>Open and Closed Contours</H3>
<P>Version 1.5 of Engauge Digitizer first offered support for open and
closed contours. The Connect As property of a curve can be changed to
Contour, and then the points of that curve are connected according to
their age, with one exception. Any point created along an existing contour
line (which would have two older endpoints) is treated as if the new
point was created sometime between the two endpoints, and inserted between
them.</P>
