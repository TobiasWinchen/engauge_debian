  Engauge Digitizer - Fixing The Axis Points</H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P>If you are seeing unexpected values for the coordinates produced by 
Engauge Digitizer, then there probably is a problem with the axis 
points. Axis point problems include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>An axis point was placed at the wrong location on the graph</LI>
<LI>The X or Y coordinate of an axis point was entered incorrectly</LI>
<LI>In a polar plot, the origin has a nonzero radius (so the default value of zero
in the <A HREF="dlgcoordsys.html">Coordinates Dialog</A> does not apply)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The trick for identifying the problem
is to turn on Grid Display (in the View menu). Once
the grid lines are displayed on top of the original, just read the
coordinates along a few grid lines in the Status Bar, and the problem
should become apparent, so you can fix it. For example, in the following 
picture the Y coordinate of the axis point on the right was typed 
incorrectly:</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="fixingaxispoints.png" ALT="Picture of slanted grid lines"></P>
<P>This trick is also helpful if your axis points are fine, but the problem 
lies in the original image.</P>
