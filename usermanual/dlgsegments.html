<P>
The segments dialog controls how Segment Fill is applied to 
line graphs. You can control:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Minimum segment length</LI>
<LI>Separation (or spacing) of the generated points along the segment</LI>
<LI>Thickness of the segment line that is displayed during Segment Fill</LI>
<LI>Color of the segment line that is displayed during Segment Fill</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A line in the processed image is a candidate for segment fill if it
is longer than the specified minimum segment length. Clicking on that
segment will then cause points to be created along that line, separated
by the specified point separation.</P>
<P>The preview window displays the current settings.</P>
