<P>
The Grid Removal dialog lets you remove grid lines in the original
image. The resulting processed image is used in Segment Fill and
Point Match. To see the processed image, select the
View/Processed Image menu option.</P>
<P>There are three methods for removing grid lines:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Remove pixels of a particular color.</LI>
<LI>Remove pixels close to regularly spaced gridlines.</LI>
<LI>Remove thin lines parallel to the axes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>When removing pixels of a particular color, you can click on a pixel
in the Preview window to select that color.</P>
<P>When removing pixels close to regularly spaced grid lines, you 
must specify those grid lines, and the margin around each line. This
option is only available when the axes have been defined.</P>
<P>When removing thin lines parallel to the axes, you specify the 
minimum thickness. If a line is so thin that it is thinner than this
number of pixels, in either the horizontal or vertical directions, then
that line is removed.</P>
<P>Since removing grid lines usually leaves gaps, smaller gaps produced
by grid removal will be removed. The maximum gap size is an option
that applies if any grid removal options is chosen.</P>
<P>The Grid Removal settings that successfully remove all grid lines
in the gridlines_log.png example are shown below.</P>
