Introduction
------------
The usermanual directory contains documentation for the Engauge Digitizer tool.
You can access the documentation by loading the index.html file into your browser.

While running Engauge Digitizer, selecting some of the options under the Help
menu will open up a simple browser, with one of the User Manual pages displayed
in the browser window.

All of the User Manual documentation is also available at http://digitizer.sourceforge.net,
along with a lot of other useful information. Users are encouraged to search for help
in the Help and Open Discussion forums at that site.
