Mac OSX
-------
Option 1) OSX 10.X 64 bit distributions can execute the DMG file 

Option 2) Engauge can be built from source code. This requires a lot of effort and is not recommended.

Debian Distributions
--------------------
Option 1) Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu and Kubuntu, do not currently offer the newest Engauge Digitizer as 
          packages (although this will hopefully change soon). So, the debian installer 
          (digit-exe-debian-linux-32-bit-installer-X_Y.run) is released for installing into Debian systems. 
          The Debian installer included in this release has been tested in 32 and 64 bit Kubuntu and Knoppix.

Option 2) Engauge can be built from source code. This requires a lot of effort and is not recommended.

Red Hat Distributions
---------------------
Option 1) Red Hat-based distributions, such as Fedora and Centos, offer the newest Engauge Digitizer as packages.

Option 2) Engauge can be built from source code. This requires a lot of effort and is not recommended.

Windows
-------
Option 1) Windows release WITH INSTALLER (digit-exe-windows-32-bit-installer-X_Y.msi): 
          The Windows MSI installer included in this release has been tested in Windows XP and Windows 8, and in 32 and 64
          bit operating systems. This installer is recommended when installing in a user account with administrative rights,
          since it creates helpful shortcuts and can be managed through the Control Panel.

Option 2) Windows release WITHOUT INSTALLER (digit-exe-windows-32-bit-without-installer-X_Y.msi): 
          The Windows ZIP file included in this release has been tested in Windows XP and Windows 7, with 32 and 64
          bit operating systems. After unzipping the files into a directory, clicking on the engauge.exe executable file 
          runs Engauge Digitizer. Installing from this zip file is the only option when working in a user account without
          administrative rights (since the MSI installer cannot be used).

Option 3) Engauge can be built from source code. This requires a lot of effort and is not recommended.
