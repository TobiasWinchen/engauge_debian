    <p>
      This open source digitizing software converts an image file
      showing a graph or map into numbers. The image file can come
      from a scanner, digital camera, or a screen-shot. The numbers
      can be read on the screen and written or copied to a
      spreadsheet. The process starts with an image file containing a
      graph or map. The final result is digitized data that can be
      used by other tools such as spreadsheet and numerical computation
      programs.
