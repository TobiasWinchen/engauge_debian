		<p>
			The Engauge Digitizer tool assists in interactively extracting numbers
			from images of graphs. Conceptually, it is thus the opposite of a
			graphing tool that converts data points to graphs. It provides assistance
			in enhancing the image quality and matching the data points. Engauge
			Digitizer is used by individuals such as grad students and researchers as
			well as engineers and employees in large government and commercial
			organizations for processing single files but also managing databases of
			thousands of image files.
