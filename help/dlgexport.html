<P>
The Export Setup dialog is very powerful, so that exported files can
can be easily imported into other tools such as Excel and Gnumeric.
</P>
<P>
Only curves may be exported, so this dialog ignores all measures.
</P>
<P>
Every curve will be exported by default. To prevent a curve from getting
exported, select the curve name and then click on the Exclude button. 
Clicking on the Include button will return the curve to the export list.
</P>
<P>
The curves are exported as a set of points. The user may control
which points are exported. X values from all curves, just the first curve,
or from the grid lines may be selected, and corresponding Y values
will be calculated. The raw X and Y values can also be selected, although
this format is typically less useful to other applications.
</P>
<P>
Between each two fields (or entries) in the export file, there is
a delimiter. The type of delimiter may be selected in this dialog, so 
the exported file can be easily read into another application. Examples
of delimiters are commas, spaces and tabs.
</P>
<P>
By default, a simple header line is inserted at the top of each 
exported file. This header line contains the names of each column
of data. Such popular spreadsheet programs as Excel and Gnumeric
can read the column names from the simple header line. The header
line can be removed, or slightly changed for compatibility with
Gnuplot. If you want complete Gnuplot compatibility, spaces should 
be used as delimiters.

An example of the export setup for a simple document is shown below:
