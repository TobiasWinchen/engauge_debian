<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P>
The point match dialog controls how Point Match is applied to 
point graphs. You can control:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Maximum point size</LI>
<LI>Accepted point color</LI>
<LI>Rejected point color</LI>
<LI>Candidate color</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The maximum point size prevents sample points from being too large. Occasionally
a sample point will lie on top of a grid line or axis line, which confuses 
Engauge because it is not able to distinguish the point from the grid or
axis line. The maximum point size value limits the width and height of the
sample point so that, at most, only a few pixels of the grid or axis line 
are attached.
</P>
<P STYLE="background: pink; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">HINT - For the best point matching,
make the maximum point size as small as possible.
The best size is just large enough to include the entire sample point in the point match circle.
</P>
<P>Colors are used to distinguish accepted points, rejected points, and the
candidate point from each other.

The Preview window display the settings.
