<P>
The Discretize dialog lets you adjust how the original image 
is processed. The processed image is used in Segment Fill and
Point Match. To see the processed image, select the
View/Processed Image menu option.</P>
<P>When the original image is processed, the Discretize settings
determine which attribute of the picture will be used to
determine if each pixel is 'on', or 'off'. The availabe
attributes are:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Intensity</B>, similar to Value, refers to the degree of 
lightness or darkness.</LI>
<LI><B>Foreground</B> is defined as any part of the image that is not the
background color. The background color is defined to be the color
that appears most often in the original image.</LI>
<LI><B>Hue</B> is the color. It ranges from red, through various
colors, and then back to red.</LI>
<LI><B>Saturation</B> refers to the degree of hue. Unsaturated colors are
considered black, white and shades of gray.</LI>
<LI><B>Value</B>, similar to Intensity, refers to the degree of 
lightness or darkness.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Select an attribute. A histogram of the attribute values will 
appear in the histogram window. If necessary, click and drag the two tabs 
in that window to change the attribute range. Your changes
will appear in the Preview window.</P>
