<H3>Reading Coordinates In Status Bar</H3>
<P>
The coordinates of any specific point on a curve can be seen in the 
status bar, the only requirement being that the axes points 
must already be defined. When all three axes points are defined, the
coordinates under the cursor are always displayed, so place the
cursor over a point on the curve to determine the coordinates at that point.
</P>
<P>
The status bar coordinates must be recorded by the user, or manually 
typed into other applications.
</P>
<P>
This approach does not work for maps using scale bars.
</P>
<H3>Exporting Curves Into An Export File</H3>
<P>
Curves may be exported into an export file using the File/Export menu option.
The export file is a tabular text file that can be imported directly into
other software tools like Excel and Gnumeric.
</P>
<P>
The format of the export file can be controlled by using the 
<A HREF="dlgexport.html">File/Export Setup</A> menu option.
</P>
<P>
This approach does not work for maps using scale bars.
</P>
<H3>Copying From The Geometry Info Windows</H3>
<P>
All of the information in the 
<A HREF="dlgcurvegeometry.html">curve geometry</A> and
<A HREF="dlgmeasuregeometry.html">measure geometry</A> windows
can be copied using the operating system clipboard. All selected lines
are automatically copied to the clipboard, where they are available for
pasting into other applications.
</P>
<P>
This approach works for both curves and maps using scale bars.
