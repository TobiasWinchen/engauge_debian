Unfortunately, the developers are no longer able to offer Mac OSX 
releases. Until mid-2006, we were able to build Mac OSX releases
on free computers offered by Sourceforge.net, but those free
services are no longer available.

Although Mac OSX users are still able to build Engauge Digitizer 
from source code, this is not recommended for most people. You 
will have to build two other software packages first - Qt from
Trolltech.com and FFTW from fftw.org. Building all three packages
from source code can take hours, even if no problems are encountered.

However, OSX users have two easier options:

Option 1) The gracious people at ATG (http://naranja.umh.es/~atg)
          have been offering Mac OSX release packages for several
          years. You will find Engauge Digitizer in their Qt3.3.x 
          software section. Thanks ATG!

Option 2) Jack Fink maintains Engauge Digitizer in the Fink
          distribution (http://finkproject.org). Thanks Jack!
