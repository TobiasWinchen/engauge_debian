Introduction
------------
The src directory contains the source code necessary to generate the 'Engauge Digitizer' 
software program. This program has fairly extensive documentation in the usermanual 
directory - that documentation is accessed by opening usermanual/index.html in your
browser.

Building the software
---------------------
Please note that this software is NOT compiled and linked using autoconf and automake.
Instead, this is built with the qmake utility provided by Trolltech (www.trolltech.com),
and requires the Qt library from the same company. More information about building this
software is found in the INSTALL file in the main directory. A GPL version of Qt is 
supplied with most Linux distributions for developing open source projects. Please 
refer to the Qt licensing restrictions at www.trolltech.com for further information.

Licensing
---------
All of the files in this directory were created by an Engauge Digitizer developer, and
are subject to the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; 
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
