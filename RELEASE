This file documents how to generate release packages for distribution
to Sourceforge. See file INSTALL for instructions on installing
a release package.

RELEASE - Source / Linux 
---------------
This assumes  Qt 4.x is already installed on the computer.

1.  Change the version number in digitdef.cpp and rebuild the executable

      VersionNumber = QString ("X.Y");
      VersionNumbersSupported << "X.0" << "X.1" << ... << "X.Y";

    where X is the major version number and Y is the minor version number.
    The document file formats do not change between minor versions.

2.  Run test cases using valgrind (http://valgrind.kde.org) to check 
    for uninitialized variables and memory leaks

      valgrind --leak-check=yes engauge 

3. Create source tarball
	git archive master --prefix engauge-VERSION/ -o /tmp/engauge_VERSION.tgz

4. Test compilation and installation from source

5. Tag git version

6.  Upload the tarball to sourceforge
